# GamingApp
Created during Mosh React Course. Trying on my own and using the videos as needed. Chakra for the UI, Vite, axios.

This one is actually cool asf, mostly working on passing query params around

Steps to Run:
1) clone down project
2) cd game-hub
3) npm run dev

Note: Some errors with the fetch, not sure if the API is still getting all the games, does have some and the filter on the side still works
